# How to organize a network of term and show the most relevant terms around one term

Similiar to Co-citation, if two Wikipedia pages contain similar set of terms, those two pages are highly related.
Using this method, we can rank all terms in a Wikipedia page by their relation to the current term

However, this ranking method will assign a high rank to items at the same level with the current item while
assign a lower rank to items at different levels.
e.g. If the input is SARS, this method will return MERS, coronavirus, or other resparitary virus that are at the same level 
with SARS. It will less likely to return higher level terms like "virus" "micro-organism" or lower level terms like 
"SARS outbreak in China"
